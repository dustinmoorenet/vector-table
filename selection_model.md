Every item needs to be able to report this overall shape
that shape is then put in the overlay layer
anytime one of those shapes is touched it reports that the underlaying item
is selected.
this allows group levels to be "focusable" so that no items above or below that
group level can be selected
The selection tool can then sum up the overall shapes to handle visualizing the
selection.
