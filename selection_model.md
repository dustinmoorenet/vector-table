Just use the shapes themself as the selection handles. When an item is selected,
the item is compared against the ceiling item. An item is selected if it is a

Overlay handles have precedent over shapes which has precedent over the background.

First, set a ceiling item and report child item of it when a child (or itself) is
selected.
